## 🔐 Security Implementation

✅ **Password Hashing**
- `password_hash()` in User model
- `password_verify()` in AuthController
- bcrypt algorithm (default)

- PDO with prepared statements
- Parameterized queries throughout

✅ **XSS Protection**
- Input sanitization via Validator class
- htmlspecialchars on all outputs

✅ **Session Security**
- Secure session management

## 🎯 Demo Script

### For Lecturer Presentation:

**1. Introduction (1 min)**
> "I built SafeBite Tracker, a food safety inspection system where health inspectors can register and track food vendors."

**2. Database Setup (1 min)**
> "Here's my database with users and vendors tables. Passwords are hashed using password_hash()."

**3. Login Demo (2 mins)**
> "I'll login as john_inspector. The system uses password_verify() to check credentials and creates a secure session."

**4. Add Vendor (2 mins)**
> "I can add a new food vendor with name, description, and location. The system links it to my user ID automatically."

**5. View All Vendors (2 mins)**
> "Here are all vendors. Notice the JOIN query shows which user added each vendor. I only see Edit/Delete buttons on MY vendors."

**6. Update Demo (2 mins)**
> "I can edit my vendor. If I try to edit another user's vendor, I get an error - ownership check."

**7. Delete Demo (1 min)**
> "Similarly, I can only delete my own vendors. The system prevents unauthorized deletions."

**8. Security Features (1 min)**
> "The system uses password_hash/verify, prepared statements for SQL injection prevention, and ownership validation."

## 📝 Code Highlights for Lecturer

### Password Security (Req #1, #2)
```php
// backend/models/User.php
public function create() {
    $hashedPassword = password_hash($this->password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
    // ... INSERT with hashed password
}

public function verifyLogin($username, $password) {
    $user = $this->findByUsername($username);
    if ($user && password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {
        return $user;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### JOIN Query (Req #4)
```php
// backend/models/Vendor.php
public function getAll() {
    $query = "SELECT v.*, u.username, u.email 
              FROM vendors v
              LEFT JOIN users u ON v.user_id = u.id
              ORDER BY v.created_at DESC";
    // ...
}
```

### Ownership Check (Req #5, #6)
```php
// backend/controllers/VendorController.php
public function update($id) {
    if (!$vendorModel->isOwner($id, $_SESSION['user_id'])) {
        Response::forbidden('You can only edit vendors you created');
    }
    // ... proceed with UPDATE
}
```
